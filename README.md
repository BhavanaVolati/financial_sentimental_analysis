# financial_sentimental_analysis

## Project Overview
In today's financial markets, quickly interpreting and acting on news can be crucial for investment and decision-making. This project focuses on sentiment analysis of financial news articles to understand market sentiment and predict potential market movements. By applying various data preprocessing, machine learning, and sentiment analysis techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into market trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing financial news articles. Each row in the dataset represents a news article with its associated sentiment label:
* Columns:
  * neutral: The sentiment label of the news article (neutral, negative, positive).
  * News: The content of the financial news article.
## Project Structure
The main jupyter notebook contains the structure of the workflow.
## Key Steps

* Load and Preprocess Data:
  * Clean text data:
remove non-word characters, lowercase, strip spaces, and lemmatize words.
  * Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.

* Train and Evaluate Model:
  * Split data into training and testing sets.
  * Train a Random Forest Classifier.
  * Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Perform Sentiment Analysis:
  * Calculate sentiment scores using VADER.
  * Label sentiments based on VADER scores.
* Visualize Results:
  * Plot sentiment distribution and word clouds.
  * Create ROC curves to evaluate model performance.
## Future Work
* Explore Additional Models: Experiment with other machine learning algorithms to improve classification performance.
* Expand Data Sources: Include additional data sources such as social media or global financial news.
* Real-Time Analysis: Integrate real-time sentiment analysis for more timely insights.
* Improve Accuracy: Refine preprocessing steps and feature extraction techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of sentiment predictions.
